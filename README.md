Debugging Catuuurday

Home page - import AppState as Appstate (creating a second appstate)
Home page - prop passes whole collection
Home page - prop passed is not data bound
CatComponent - prop name is incorrect
CatComponent - props are not taken in on setup
CatComponent - v-for does not have a key
CatComponent - Use Route isn't imported
Router index.js - id on factpage is not bound
CatService - exporting as catsService instead of catService
CatComponent - Cat data is not referencing the state before it references the fact incorrectly
CatService - Response res.data needs to be res.data.data (ALWAYS CHECK THE RESPONSE FROM THE SERVER)
Axios Service - base url for api puts a / before the query
Axios Service - base url is missing Https from api request, causing a CORS error
